### extra-speedLedger.js
In my business i have
  Many articles with many variations made to order from customers paying VAT.
  Discounts not based on %
  Customers are 50% returning and 50% new ( often get customer details in mail)
  Before i needed dual monitors and a calculator and did a lot of switching apps and copy pasting inbetween to get the job done and I went to great lengths to avoid doing invoicing .
  So i did this to make my invoicing smother i will never regain the time it took to implement this in time savings doing invoicing but the time i have used is time i would otherwise had used avoiding to do invoicing so its a big win allready.

* Adds an in line field that allows you to create a customer by pasting a standard formatted swedish customer address in one go and have all parts inserted into the right imput fields.

* Adds an in line Exclude VAT calculator where you can insert price incl VAT and get EX VAT calculated an selected to easily copy paste into price field.

* Adds calculation of The total sum incl VAT and shows that next to the totals excluding VAT

The application is gwt based so it is a hassle script id:s are dynamic so some locators are dependent on swedish language labels.

### hitta-address.js
* Adds name to the address fields of hitta.se details page to make it easy to copy a full valid address in one go
